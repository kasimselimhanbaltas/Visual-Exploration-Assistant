## This project is a android app for visually impaired people.

This project aims to help blind people to be aware of their surroindings such as bench, column in the building, stairs, automats, doors and elevators.

For the demo, we trained a deep learning model with the images of the objects in our university campus. 

When an object is detected, the user is warned by audio message about what is the object and how far it is and the vibration about direction of the object. 
By this way, they can experience a better walk in the campus!
